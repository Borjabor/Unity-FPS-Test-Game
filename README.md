# Unity-FPS-Test-Game
Simple one-level game made as learning exercise for Unity during GameDev course

Aside from a few textures and soud effects imported from the Unity Asset Store, all everything was made by myself.
This is a simple game, and works seamlessly from the Main Menu to the end of the level run. 

A few scripts made for this level:
-Simple FPS controller using Unity's old input system with headbob
-Raycast shooting to take down targets and enemy
-Enemy with either idle or chasing state, depending on a few cases (free roams of not chasing)
-Simple timer and final time
-Target count to give access or not to final goal
